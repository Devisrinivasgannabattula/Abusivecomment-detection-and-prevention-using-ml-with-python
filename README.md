# Abusive Comment Detection and Prevention Using Machine Learning with Python
This is my final year project in my under graduation(Bachelor of Technology).
A Machine learning-based system to detect abusive comments and classify user behavior in real-time, using Python and Tkinter.

## 🚀 Overview

- Detects and blocks abusive comments using a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on **TF-IDF** features.
- Classifies non-abusive comments into categories like **Threat**, **Insult**, **Suggestion**, and **Encouragement**.
- Real-time feedback through a clean **Tkinter GUI** interface.
- Logs abusive comments into a CSV file with timestamps for moderation.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- TF-IDF Vectorization

## 📋 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/abusive-comment-detection.git
cd abusive-comment-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python abusive_detection_app.py
```

## 📈 Model

- **Classifier**: Random Forest
- **Accuracy**: ~73% on test data
- **Extra**: Behavior classification based on keyword analysis

## 📜 Future Work

- Multilingual abusive detection
- Web-based deployment (Flask / Streamlit)
- Advanced NLP models (BERT, LSTM)
